# 🔐 Password Strength Classification  

This project aims to classify passwords based on their strength using **machine learning models** such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**  
Weak passwords pose security risks. This project helps analyze and predict **password strength** based on given training data. The model classifies passwords into different categories (e.g., weak, medium, strong) using various machine learning techniques.
